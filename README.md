# fedora-rpms

* This is a repository of packages that I use on Fedora and CentOS/RHEL. 
* Changes to `.spec` files trigger automatic builds in [COPR](https://copr.fedorainfracloud.org/). 
* You can find the RPM packages in the DNF repository at https://copr.fedorainfracloud.org/coprs/johan/fedora-rpms/

## Usage

You can install the packages after enabling this repository (`dnf copr enable johan/fedora-rpms` or `yum copr enable johan/fedora-rpms`).
